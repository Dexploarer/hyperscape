## üéØ Required Cursor Rules Directory Structure

### `.cursor/rules/` - Development Rules

The following rule files should be created in `.cursor/rules/`:

#### 1. **coding-standards.mdc**

alwaysApply: true
globs: *.ts,*.tsx,*.js,*.jsx

# TypeScript Strong Typing Rules

## Core Principles
- NO `any` or `unknown` types
- Prefer classes over interfaces for type definitions
- Share types across modules from types/core.ts
- Avoid property checks on polymorphic objects
- Make strong type assumptions based on context

## Required Patterns
- Use non-null assertions: `value!`
- Define return types explicitly on public methods
- Use discriminated unions for variant types
- Import types with `import type { TypeName }`

## Forbidden Patterns
- `as any` - NEVER use this
- Property existence checks like `'property' in object`
- Optional chaining for type narrowing
```

#### 2. **architecture-patterns.mdc**
```markdown

alwaysApply: true

# Hyperscape Architecture Patterns

## Tech Stack
- Hyperscape (packages/hypefy) - 3D multiplayer game engine
- ElizaOS - AI agent framework with plugin-hyperscape
- Three.js - 3D graphics library
- Playwright - Browser automation for testing
- SQLite - Persistence layer

## Core Principles
- Always make features self-contained and modular
- Build toward the general case, not specific examples
- Separate data from logic - no hardcoded data
- Use existing Hyperscape systems instead of new abstractions
- Keep RPG isolated from Hyperscape core as standalone .hyp app

## File Organization
- Define types in types.ts files
- Use existing types before creating new ones
- Make packages self-contained with workspace imports
- Avoid circular dependencies
```

#### 3. **testing-standards.mdc**
```markdown
---
alwaysApply: true
description: Testing methodologies and requirements
---
# Real Testing Standards

## Core Principles
- NO mocks, spies, or test framework abstractions
- Build mini-worlds for each feature test
- Use real Hyperscape instances with Playwright
- Test multimodal verification (data + visual)

## Testing Methods
1. **Three.js Testing** - Check scene hierarchy and positions
2. **Visual Testing** - Screenshot analysis with colored cube proxies
3. **System Integration** - ECS systems and data introspection
4. **LLM Verification** - GPT-4o for image analysis when needed

## Visual Testing Proxies
- üî¥ Players
- üü¢ Goblins  
- üîµ Items
- üü° Trees
- üü£ Banks
- üü® Stores

## Requirements
- Every feature MUST have tests
- All tests MUST pass before moving on
- Use real gameplay, real objects, real data
- Save error logs to /logs folder
```

#### 4. **development-workflow.mdc**
```markdown
---
alwaysApply: true
description: Development workflow and file management
---
# Development Workflow Rules

## File Management
- NEVER create new files unless absolutely necessary
- Revise existing files instead of creating _v2.ts
- Delete old files completely when replacing
- Update all imports in dependent files
- Clean up orphaned files immediately

## Code Quality
- Write production code only - no examples or shortcuts
- Implement complete functionality, no TODOs
- Don't work around problems - fix root causes
- Research Hyperscape systems before creating new ones

## Environment Setup
- Use environment variables in .env with dotenv
- Keep Hyperscape isolated from RPG code
- Make each package self-contained and modular
- Use workspace imports for package communication
```

#### 5. **security-protocols.mdc**
```markdown
---
alwaysApply: true
description: Security requirements and practices
---
# Security Protocols

## API Keys and Credentials
- Store API keys in root .env file
- Use dotenv package for environment variable access
- Never hardcode credentials in source code
- Document all required API keys and credentials

## Data Protection
- All authentication handled by Privy (industry-standard)
- JWT tokens for secure session management
- No passwords stored on Hyperscape servers
- Automatic session refresh and token rotation

## Web3 Security
- Maintain flexibility for both Web3 and traditional auth
- Implement proper wallet connection strategies
- Support blockchain interactions securely
- Ensure proper transaction handling
```

#### 6. **performance-guidelines.mdc**
```markdown
---
globs: *.ts,*.tsx
description: Performance optimization standards
---
# Performance Guidelines

## Hyperscape Optimization
- Use Hyperscape abstractions where possible
- Minimize test-specific code and objects
- Optimize for 50-100 concurrent players
- Monitor memory usage (4GB+ recommended)

## Three.js Best Practices
- Leverage Hyperscape's 3D abstractions
- Use existing scene hierarchy patterns
- Optimize rendering for multiplayer scenarios
- Implement proper cleanup on unmount

## Database Performance
- SQLite handles thousands of players efficiently
- Use proper indexing for player data
- Optimize queries for real-time updates
```

#### 7. **api-standards.mdc**
```markdown
---
description: API versioning and documentation standards
---
# API Standards

## REST API Endpoints
- GET /api/state - Available state queries
- GET /api/state/player-stats?playerId=123 - Player information
- POST /api/actions/attack - Execute player actions
- GET /api/actions/available?playerId=123 - Available actions

## Documentation Requirements
- Document all API endpoints thoroughly
- Include request/response examples
- Specify required parameters and authentication
- Maintain API versioning for breaking changes

## Error Handling
- Implement comprehensive error handling
- Provide meaningful error messages
- Log errors to /logs folder for debugging
- Handle edge cases gracefully
```
