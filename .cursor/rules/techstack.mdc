Hyperscape (in packages/hypefy) - A 3D multiplayer game engine built on three.js -- includes voice with LiveKit, avatars with VRM, an application abstraction for building self-contained world apps and more
We need to make sure we build persistence into Hyperscape for our apps

Playwright - Browser engine for running tests and simulating gameplay

React - UI and frontend is done in React

ElizaOS - Our AI agent framework. Eliza runs with 'elizaos start' and we have a plugin-hyperscape for Eliza which enables Eliza plugins to join Hyperscape worlds and call all available actions.

Three.js - Our 3D graphics library -- we should try to use the Hyperscape abstractions where possible

Sqlite - for persistence we will store all application data in the database, which is currently a local Sqlite instance# Tech Stack
