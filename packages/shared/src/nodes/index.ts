/**
 * nodes/index.ts - Hyperscape Node System Exports
 * 
 * Central export point for all Node types in Hyperscape's custom scene graph system.
 * 
 * **What are Nodes?**
 * Nodes are Hyperscape's alternative to raw THREE.Object3D instances.
 * They provide lifecycle hooks, physics integration, and automatic state management.
 * 
 * **Available Node Types:**
 * - Node: Base class (abstract)
 * - Group: Container node
 * - Mesh: Renderable geometry
 * - SkinnedMesh: Animated character mesh
 * - LOD: Level-of-detail container
 * - Avatar: VRM character model
 * - Action: Executable player action
 * - Anchor: Spatial anchor for XR
 * - Nametag: Player/NPC name label
 * - Particles: Particle effect emitter
 * - UI, UIView, UIText: 3D UI elements
 * - RigidBody: Physics-enabled object
 * - Collider: Collision shape
 * 
 * **Lowercase Aliases:**
 * All nodes are also exported with lowercase names for factory function compatibility:
 * createNode('mesh', data) uses the lowercase export 'mesh' â†’ Mesh class
 * 
 * **Referenced by:** createNode(), glbToNodes(), Entity system, Client loaders
