/**
 * playerEmotes.ts - Player Animation Asset URLs
 * 
 * Centralized list of animation asset URLs for player characters.
 * These Mixamo-compatible animations are applied to VRM avatars.
 * 
 * Animation Files:

 * - Located in /assets/emotes/ directory
 * - Query parameter `?s=1.5` sets playback speed (1.5x faster)
 * 
 * Usage:
 * - PlayerLocal and PlayerRemote use these for character animation
 * - Avatar system retargets animations to VRM skeleton
 * - Emotes are applied via avatar.setEmote(Emotes.WALK)
 * 
 * Referenced by: PlayerLocal, PlayerRemote, Avatar node
